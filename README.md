# Human-Finder-BT
Natural disasters make rescue missions risky and time-sensitive. We built Human Finder-BT, a Bluetooth-controlled robot using Arduino, thermal sensors, and Firebase to detect human presence, send real-time alerts, and navigate debris — making rescue safer and smarter.
# Human Finder-BT

A Bluetooth-controlled robotic system built for disaster response and human detection. Designed to navigate debris, detect human presence using thermal sensors, and send real-time updates via Firebase — all controlled through a smartphone.

## Project Overview

During natural disasters like earthquakes or building collapses, rescue teams face challenges accessing unstable and dangerous environments. Human Finder-BT is a **low-cost, portable robot** developed to assist in such missions by detecting trapped individuals and relaying their presence to rescue teams in real time.

This project was developed as part of the SWAYAM Fest 2025 initiative at MVJ College of Engineering.
